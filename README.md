# Getting Started with Space Odyssey

A Space-odyssey is a React-based simple application, in which an user can search and book a tickets, which are available at 
"https://cosmos-odyssey.azurewebsites.net/api/v1.0/TravelPrices". After a successful search, the user can filter and sort a results and finally book a suitable 
tickets. In order to save a reservations, the user must register his/her name, which is then saved with reservations  to the local storage.
For using the application locally, one should clone a repository. After cloning, open a terminal, move to the cloned folder and  type "npm install". Then start the server with "npm start".

NB! There can be a CORS error in fetching a data from server (CORS header ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ is missing). A temporary solution could be to download an extension Like CORS Everywhere (Modzilla Firefox )or Allow CORS (Chrome), which one should certainly turn off after the finishing of using the application.
